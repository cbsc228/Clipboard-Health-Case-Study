# Clipboard-Health-Case-Study
This case study was performed by myself as an application submission to Clipboard Health. The goal of this case study was to identify trends and provide recommendations to the client with minimal guidance. The data used is publicly available and has no potential issues of confidentiality here. 

The dataset used can be found at https://data.cms.gov/quality-of-care/payroll-based-journal-daily-nurse-staffing/data
